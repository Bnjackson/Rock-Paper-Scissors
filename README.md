# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors using JavaScript, playable in console. 

First JavaScript project from the Odin Project. 
* This project helped me improve my problem solving skills. Breaking a larger problem down into smaller problems, and tackling them one by one.
* Practise using variables, conditions, functions and loops together. 
* Learned more about scope and accessibility.
